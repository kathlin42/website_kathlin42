The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. 
Brandon Sanderson - The Way of Kings


And so, does the destination matter? 
Or is it the path we take? 
I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. 
We are not creatures of destinations. 
It is the journey that shapes us. 
Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived. 
Brandon Sanderson - The Way of Kings


Somebody has to start. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right.
