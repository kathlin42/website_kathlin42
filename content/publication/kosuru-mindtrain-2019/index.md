abstract: We introduce MindTrain, a novel, gamified neurofeedback training environment that allows users to learn the skill to voluntarily self-regulate their brain activity in Virtual Reality (VR). MindTrain combines the concept of implicit control with a mobile consumer EEG-wearable in an interactive and immersive VR-environment for visualising the feedback. We tested the feasibility of MindTrain for training to control states of relaxation and concentration.
