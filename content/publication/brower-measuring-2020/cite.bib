  abstract = {Psychologists with their expertise in statistics and regarding human perception and behavior can contribute valuable insights to the development of innovative and useful artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Therefore, we need to raise attention and curiosity for AI and foster the willingness to engage with it among psychology students. This requires identifying approaches to integrate a general understanding of AI technology into formal psychological training and education. This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use AI and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students? attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI. In summary, we identified relevant factors for designing AI training approaches in psychology curricula. In this way, possible restraints regarding the use of AI can be reduced and its beneficial opportunities exploited in psychological contexts.},
