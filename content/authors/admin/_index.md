I am currently a PhD student in the Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab at the Universit Oldenburg and neuroscientist in the Applied Neurocognitive System Lab at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering. 

My research investigates neuronal correlates associated with cognitive processes during emotional distraction using EEG, MEG and fNIRS. 

I am interested in new approaches in signal processing as well as encoding and decoding approaches to better understand how our brain processes emotional stimuli during ongoing cognitive tasks not only in laboratory settings but also in our everyday life.
